```

### Step 2: Gmail Setup (Recommended)

   - Go to Google Account Settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification
   - Generate "App Password" for Mail
   - Copy the 16-character password
3. **Use App Password** (NOT your regular Gmail password)

### Step 3: Test Email System

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3002/api/email/test
   ```
2. **Create Test Ticket**: Create a ticket through the UI

4. **Test Resolution**: Mark ticket resolved and send email

## 📊 EMAIL MONITORING
