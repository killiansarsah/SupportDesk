# Email System Setup Guide

Your support ticket system now includes comprehensive email notifications! Here's how to set it up:

## üîß Email Configuration

### Production Setup with SendGrid (Railway + Vercel)

1. **Create & verify your sender in SendGrid**

   - Add a _Single Sender_ or authenticate your domain inside the SendGrid dashboard.
   - The email you verify here must match the `EMAIL_FROM` you configure below.

2. **Generate an API key**

   - Create a key with "Mail Send" permission.
   - Copy it once; you will paste it into Railway.

3. **Configure environment variables in Railway (backend)**

   ```text
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxx
   EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_SECURE=false
   SMTP_USER=apikey
   EMAIL_FROM=support@yourdomain.com
   EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Your Support Team
   COMPANY_NAME=Your Company
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   EMAIL_ALLOW_DEMO=false
   ```

   > Tip: set these under _Variables ‚Üí Add Variable_ in your Railway project so redeploys pick them up automatically.

4. **Point the frontend at the deployed API**

   - In Vercel, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app`.
   - Redeploy the frontend so it uses the live backend.

5. **Redeploy & verify**
   - Restart the Railway service after saving variables.
   - Watch the backend logs on boot ‚Äì you should see `üìß Email: Configured` along with the host and from address.
   - Hit `https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app/api/email/test` to trigger a test message.

### Backend Setup (Required)

1. **Configure Gmail App Password** (Recommended):

   - Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Navigate to Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification
   - Generate an "App Password" for Mail
   - Copy the 16-character app password

2. **Update Backend Environment Variables**:
   Edit `backend/.env` and configure:
   ```env
   # Email Configuration
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   COMPANY_NAME=Your Support Desk
   SUPPORT_PHONE=(555) 123-4567
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5174
   ```

### Alternative Email Providers

#### Using Custom SMTP Server:

```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=smtp
SMTP_HOST=smtp.yourdomain.com
SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=support@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-password
```

#### Using SendGrid via SMTP:

```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=apikey
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxx
EMAIL_FROM=support@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Your Support Team
```

> Verify `support@yourdomain.com` inside SendGrid before sending, otherwise emails will be dropped.

#### Using Outlook/Hotmail:

```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=smtp
SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-password
```
